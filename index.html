                                    I was the lead Electrical Power System engineer for the University of Southampton
                                    Small Satellite (UoS3) project in 2020/21, as my masters group design project.
                                    Despite a year plagued with COVID issues that affected access to facilities, we
                                    were able to make a significant amount of progress in both the EPS system and the
                                    project overall.

                                    At the start of the year, we found the EPS module of the software was untested,
                                    poorly documented and incomplete. The decision was made to redesign the architecture
                                    of the EPS module and perform a complete rewrite.

                                    By the end of the year, the EPS module rewrite was around 90% complete. The new
                                    software architecture is well documented and written to the same standards as the
                                    rest of the project’s software. Full software and hardware integration testing
                                    between the EPS module and the onboard computer were completed, which is a key
                                    milestone in the project’s lifecycle.

                                    My individual project in my third year at university involved studying the viability
                                    of using low-cost sensors to perform air quality monitoring across Southampton. The
                                    pollutants that I measured were PM2.5 and NO2, as well as temperature and humidity
                                    to see how the weather conditions affected pollutant levels.

                                    The system was Raspberry Pi based and used a python script to operate and take
                                    readings from the sensors, and then record the data in an organised manner in a .csv
                                    file for analysis.

                                    When compared to the sophisticated, expensive system employed by Southampton city
                                    council the results were mixed. The PM2.5 sensor showed high promise and after
                                    calibration closely mirrored the council’s system, however the analogue NO2 sensor’s
                                    results were completely random. The second part of the experiment utilised the
                                    system around the city at similar times to see how pollutant levels varied.

                                    The overall results of this experiment showed that there were low-cost sensors on
                                    the market that could produce high quality results and the benefits of developing a
                                    network of low-cost monitoring systems to gain insight into pollutant distribution
                                    across the city.

                                    When I was working at Jaguar Land Rover, I worked on the
                                    hardware in the loop (HIL) rig, this was used to simulate a vehicle, allowing the
                                    team to run a variety of software and hardware tests across multiple vehicles in one location.
                                    One of the main issues the team were facing was that the rig engineer was spending too much
                                    of her time performing ECU warranty testing, which was not an efficient use of the
                                    HIL rig and was causing some delays in completing sprints.

                                    I designed, prototyped and programmed the ECU fault induction box. This
                                    Arduino-powered device can simulate 150+ faults that were tested in the ECU
                                    warranty testing, including faults in analogue sensors, PWM sensors and other loads.

                                    The C++ script allowed the Arduino to display the current configuration onto an LCD
                                    screen to allow the user to see whether the ECU was sending the correct readings,
                                    and to generate PWM signals of a variable duty cycle to simulate six PWM sensors in
                                    the current line of vehicles.

                                    This project was a success, as the simple yet time-consuming warranty tests could
                                    still be performed, whilst other more important work could occupy the HIL rig.
